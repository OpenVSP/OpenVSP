# VSPAERO Example Cases

Most use cases of VSPAERO are relatively intuitive from within the OpenVSP GUI.  However, 
support for some advanced VSPAERO features has not yet been added to the GUI.  These
example cases serve as documentation and demonstration of those features -- and also as
a lasting demonstration of VSPAERO's features and capabilities.  Over time, this set of
examples can grow to become comprehensive.
