## Routines for Arbitrary Precision Floating-point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates ##

This repo is forked from <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html>.

This file contains C implementation of algorithms for exact addition and multiplication of floating-point numbers, and predicates for robustly performing the orientation and incircle tests used in computational geometry.  The algorithms and underlying theory are described in Jonathan Richard Shewchuk. "Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates."  Technical Report CMU-CS-96-140, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, May 1996.  (Submitted to Discrete & Computational Geometry.)
