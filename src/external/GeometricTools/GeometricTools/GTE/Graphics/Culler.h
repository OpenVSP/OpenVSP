// Support for determining the potentially visible set of Visual objects in a
// scene.  The class is designed to support derived classes that provide
// specialized culling and sorting.  One example is a culler that stores
// opaque objects in one set, sorted from front to back, and semitransparent
// objects in another set, sorted from back to front.  Another example is a
// portal system (room-graph visibility) that must maintain a set of unique
// visible objects--one object viewed through two portals should not be
// inserted into the set twice.
