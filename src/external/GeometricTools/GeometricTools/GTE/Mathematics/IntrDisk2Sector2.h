// The Circle2 object is considered to be a disk whose points X satisfy the
// constraint |X-C| <= R, where C is the disk center and R is the disk
// radius.  The Sector2 object is also considered to be a solid.  Also,
// the Sector2 object is required to be convex, so the sector angle must
// be in (0,pi/2], even though the Sector2 definition allows for angles
// larger than pi/2 (leading to nonconvex sectors).  The sector vertex is
// V, the radius is L, the axis direction is D, and the angle is A. Sector
// points X satisfy |X-V| <= L and Dot(D,X-V) >= cos(A)|X-V| >= 0.
//
// A subproblem for the test-intersection query is to determine whether
// the disk intersects the cone of the sector.  Although the query is in
// 2D, it is analogous to the 3D problem of determining whether a sphere
// and cone overlap.  That algorithm is described in
//   https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/IntersectionSphereCone.pdf
// The algorithm leads to coordinate-free pseudocode that applies to 2D
// as well as 3D.  That function is the first SphereIntersectsCone on
// page 4 of the PDF.
//
// If the disk is outside the cone, there is no intersection.  If the disk
// overlaps the cone, we then need to test whether the disk overlaps the
// disk of the sector.
