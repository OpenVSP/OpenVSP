<h1 class="title">Geometry Analysis</h1>
</header>
<p>The Geometry Analysis Manager allows the user to set up and execute
several geometric analysis tasks typical of the aircraft design
process.</p>
<p>Each analysis task is configured with the geometry or geometries
required. The primary geometry can be either a Set, Mode, or an
individual component. The secondary geometry (when required) can be
either a Set, an individual component, or (in special cases) direct
specification of a point or plane.</p>
<p>Some of the analysis tasks require a specific type of geometry for
the analysis. For example, the Plane 2pt Angle analysis used to
calculate the tail strike angle requires a 2pt Ground Plane Auxiliary
Geometry for its secondary input. These requirements are summarized in
the following table.</p>

<h2 id="external">External</h2>
<p>Check that the primary and secondary geometries are external to one
another. Before checking for interference, a CompGeom type analysis is
run on both primary and secondary geometry sets to compute each trimmed
OML -- this step allows the geometry sets to include negative
components.</p>
<h2 id="packaging">Packaging</h2>
<p>Check that the secondary geometry is contained within the primary
geometry. Before checking for interference, a CompGeom type analysis is
run on both primary and secondary geometry sets to compute each trimmed
OML -- this step allows the geometry sets to include negative
components.</p>
<h2 id="self-external">Self External</h2>
<p>Check that all surfaces of the primary geometry are external to one
another. No CompGeom type analysis is run on the geometry, so the effect
of negative components can not be considered. No secondary geometry is
required.</p>
<p>This analysis should be used instead of the <a
href="#external">External</a> analysis when you want to check external
interference between a number of simple components or between multiple
surfaces of a single geometry -- as created by either symmetry or a
complex component like a propeller.</p>
<h2 id="plane-distance">Plane Distance</h2>
<p>Calculate the minimum and maximum height of the primary geometry
above a plane specified by the secondary geometry. Before calculating
distance, a CompGeom type analysis is run on the primary geometry set to
compute each trimmed OML -- this step allows the geometry set to include
negative components. The secondary geometry is used to specify the
static reference plane. The static reference plane can be specified as a
Z-constant plane, as the nominal ground plane from a landing gear
component, or by a 3pt Ground Plane auxiliary geometry.</p>
<h2 id="plane-2pt-angle">Plane 2pt Angle</h2>
<p>Calculate the angle of first contact betwen the primary geometry and
a ground plane rotating about an axis specified by the secondary
geometry. Before calculating the angle, a CompGeom type analysis is run
on the primary geometry set to compute each trimmed OML -- this step
allows the geometry set to include negative components. The secondary
geometry must be specified by a 2pt Ground Plane auxiliary geometry.</p>
<p>If the specified contact points are bogies with multiple wheels in
tandem, rotation will occur about the line connecting the bogie pivots
up to the maximum bogie pivot angle. Beyond that limit, rotation will
occur about the line connecting the appropriate wheel axles while the
bogies are at maximum pivot. If the contact points do not have multiple
wheels in tandem, rotation will occur about the line connecting the
wheel axles.</p>
<h2 id="tipback">Tipback</h2>
<p>Calculate the angle from vertical to the center of gravity about the
line connecting the landing gear pivots. The pivot point and center of
gravity envelope are specified by a 2pt Ground Plane auxiliary geometry.
No secondary geometry is required. The tipback angle is calculated to
all eight possible corners of the CG envelope as well as the nominal CG
position.</p>
<h2 id="plane-1pt-angle">Plane 1pt Angle</h2>
<p>Calculate the angle of first contact betwen the primary geometry and
a ground plane rotating about a roll axis specified by the secondary
geometry. Before calculating the angle, a CompGeom type analysis is run
on the primary geometry set to compute each trimmed OML -- this step
allows the geometry set to include negative components. The secondary
geometry must be specified by a 1pt Ground Plane auxiliary geometry.</p>
<p>The roll axis goes through the outboard contact point of the
specified landing gear in the forward direction in the ground plane.</p>
<h2 id="weight-distribution">Weight Distribution</h2>
<p>Calculate the fraction of the weight reacted by each contact point
specified by the primary geometry. The contact points and center of
gravity envelope are specified by a 3pt Ground Plane auxiliary geometry.
No secondary geometry is required.</p>
<h2 id="tipover">Tipover</h2>
<p>Calculate the angle from vertical to the center of gravity about the
line connecting the landing gear contact points. The contact points and
center of gravity envelope are specified by a 2pt Ground Plane auxiliary
geometry. No secondary geometry is required. The tipover angle is
calculated to all eight possible corners of the CG envelope as well as
the nominal CG position.</p>
<h2 id="ground-manueverability">Ground Manueverability</h2>
<p>Calculate the largest arc swept by the primary geometry as well as
the ground tracks of the landing gear contact points specified by the
secondary geometry. Before calculating a CompGeom type analysis is run
on the primary geometry set to compute each trimmed OML -- this step
allows the geometry set to include negative components. The secondary
geometry must be specified by a 3pt Ground Plane auxiliary geometry. The
contact point with the largest allowed turning angle is treated as the
steerable gear. The steering angle to produce the tightest possible turn
is used (up to the turning angle limit).</p>
<h2 id="from-point-visibility">From Point Visibility</h2>
<p>Calculate the visible (or occluded) domain from a specific point in
space. Before calculating visibility, a CompGeom type analysis is run on
the primary geometry set to compute each trimmed OML -- this step allows
the geometry set to include negative components. The secondary geometry
is used to specify the viewpoint.</p>
<h2 id="composite-clearance-envelope">Composite Clearance Envelope</h2>
<p>Calculate the minimum ground clearance between the primary geometry
and a composite clearance envelope specified by the secondary geometry.
Before calculating clearance, a CompGeom type analysis is run on the
primary geometry set to compute each trimmed OML -- this step allows the
geometry set to include negative components. The secondary geometry must
be specified by a 3pt Composite Clearance Envelope auxiliary
geometry.</p>
