<p>Stack Presets can be used to initialize the current stack into a
variety of useful starting configurations. Some of these presets are
convenience features, such as <em>Default</em> and <em>Cylinder</em>.
They get the user to a helpful starting point for modeling geometry. The
other presets are to assist with engine modeling. OpenVSP supports a
variety of engine representations, which have subtle but important
differences. These differences appear both in the geometric modeling as
well as in the various parms required to set up a nacelle for analyses.
Given that there are many valid permutations of full nacelle, inlet,
and/or outlet modeling methods, a sampler of nacelle presets are
included to jump off from when developing vehicle with propulsion
modeling.</p>

<h2 id="free-presets">Free Presets</h2>
<p>These are stack presets that use the "Free" Order Policy.</p>
<h3 id="default">Default</h3>
<p>This is the default stack initialization type.</p>
<h3 id="cylinder-with-end-points">Cylinder with End Points</h3>
<p>A 4-XSec cylinder, with points as the start and end of the stack.
Skinning is disabled for the whole stack.</p>
<h3 id="cylinder-with-end-caps">Cylinder with End Caps</h3>
<p>A 2-XSec cylinder, with flat end caps for the start and end of the
stack. Skinning is disabled for this stack.</p>
<h2 id="loop-presets-nacelles">Loop Presets (Nacelles)</h2>
<p>These are the stack presets that use the "Loop" Order Policy, given
here as a variety of nacelle models. Engine modeling in OpenVSP includes
a number of subtle design choices, and not every combination of these
creates a valid or useful model. As such, we encourage users new to
engine modeling to begin from one of the included Nacelle stack
presets.</p>
<p>There area few important concepts to cover with engine modeling.</p>
<p>First is Engine Definition, in which the user defines to OpenVSP
<em>how</em> the engine geometry is modeled. The user may model the
flowpath (inlet and/or outlet) implicitly with the "Flowthrough"
definition or explicitly as a "Flowpath" definition. With these options
selected, the user indicates the applicable engine XSecs on the stack
itself, which are automatically activated/deactivated by the prior
engine definition selections.</p>

alt="Engine Definition" /></p>
<p><img src="images/EngineStations.png" title="Engine Stations"
alt="Engine Stations" /></p>
<p>Second is Engine Representation. OpenVSP uses Engine Representation
to interpret which sections of the defined engine will be used in
analyses. Once the engine is defined, there remain a subset of options
on how to represent this geometry.</p>
<p><img src="images/EngineRepresentation.png"
title="Engine Representation" alt="Engine Representation" /></p>
<p>If the geometry models the nacelle explicitly, the user may flag it
as a positive volume or remove it from analysis. All except the
"...Negative Only" options will keep the explicitly modeled nacelle
geom, while the "Negative Only" options discards the nacelle geom.</p>
<p>If the geometry implicitly models the flowpath, the user may flag it
to remain an unmodeled volume or to be a negative volume (which acts as
a boolean removal tool in analyses). The user may also choose to crop
the flowpath from its maximum definition (e.g., from full inlet/outlet
flowpath to inlet/outlet "To Face", or from inlet/outlet "To Face" to
inlet/outlet "To Lip" ).</p>

<h3 id="nacelle-flowthru-outlet-origin">Nacelle Flowthru Outlet
Origin</h3>
<p>This Nacelle is modeled as a "flow through" geometry, meaning the
inner and outer surfaces of the nacelle are explicitly modeled with the
XSecs of the stack. The flowthrough nacelle representation offers some
flexibility here: users may choose to simply leave the interior portion
of the nacelle as is, or if the nacelle intersects with other geometry
may flag the interior as "negative volume," which when performing
CompGeom or CFD work will perform a boolean cut through any other
positive volume. Additionally, users may choose to represent this
nacelle using ONLY the negative volume, omitting the nacelle itself
while preserving the implicitly-modeled flow path. Users may also crop
the XSecs represented to the face or lip of the inlet or outlet,
reducing the nacelle model to a non-flow through geometry. For these
flowthrough geometries, it is crucial that the order of the XSecs is
back-to-front on the inner surface and front-to-back on the outer
surface. This maintains the proper surface normal. As a check, users may
attach a blank geom to UW trans/rot as a child of the geom and verify
its normal direction faces out.</p>
<p>There are three variations on this flowthrough nacelle model, this
one has the outlet as its XSec origin.</p>

Additionally, the inlets and outlets may be overridden with an extend
representation.</p>

<h3 id="nacelle-flowpath-inlet--outlet">Nacelle Flowpath Inlet +
Outlet</h3>
<p>This nacelle is explicitly modeling the interior flowpath, with no
representation of the outer structure. Note that this reverses the XSec
order from the earlier paradigm, as the inlet face is the first XSec,
leading through the flowpath to the outlet face. This representation is
intended to be used as a negative flowpath, with the "negative flowpath
only" option behaving identically since there is no nacelle modeled in
the first place. This model also supports extension of inlet and
outlets.</p>
